1,1,male,Left,1,0,0,6,5,7,6,4,3,4,5,7,7,6,6,6,"it was a cool new way to get the touching feeling.
a buzz on the finger"
2,1,male,right,1,1,0,6,5,6,5,3,5,4,4,3,5,5,5,5,"electrical feels a bit like a warning
while visual was more 'preventive'"
3,1,male,right,1,1,0,7,6,7,3,3,1,4,5,6,6,6,5,4,"I quickly assimilated the tactile feedback with the contact, but it is still very different from an actual contact.
i guess the immersive environment and the feel i was touching a virtual surface helped in this assimilation.
the visual helps for the actual task
the electrotactile feedback helped for the immersion"
4,1,male,left,1,1,0,5,6,6,3,4,2,5,6,7,5,6,6,5,"it's satisfaying but a bit tiring for the arm. the device is a bit cumbersome
some small spikes in the center of my index, 'slight vibrations' on the finger"
5,2,male,right,1,0,0,7,6,5,3,3,1,2,3,7,4,6,7,3,"the feeling was unpleasant, maybe lower levels of feedback could have been more enjoyable
tingling, like getting the senses after your hand goes numb from sleeping on it for example"
6,1,female,right,1,1,1,5,6,5,5,3,2,3,3,5,6,4,5,4,"some problems with the hardware at the beginning, electrotacitle sometimes annoying
""intriguant"" in french (couldnt find the word in english), surprising?"
7,2,male,right,1,1,0,5,5,7,6,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,5,4,"the combination of tracking device plus tactile is a bit heavy for daily use.
it's a new type of tactile feedback for me and it is in midway between funny and annoying. it feels like when blood stops circulating"
8,1,male,right,0,0,0,3,2,2,5,1,1,1,3,7,5,5,7,3,"my arm was tired; the electrotactile feedback was a bit strong sometimes
it's liek getting perced by a needle"
9,4,female,left,1,0,0,5,5,4,5,5,4,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,like ants on finger
10,1,other,left,1,1,0,6,5,6,6,5,3,5,5,5,5,4,4,6,a bit like a vibration
11,1,female,right,1,1,0,5,5,5,5,3,1,2,4,3,5,5,2,4,"interesting but with some strange feelings in the finger sometimes
it can cause some strange feelings in the finger; during the experiment, it wa very helpful to know when there was a contact with the wooden box"
12,2,female,right,1,1,0,5,2,2,3,4,2,4,5,2,5,5,7,5,"i enjoyed specially the combined visual + tactile feedback. after the 2nd calibration, the tactile feedback was strong.
i think it made it less comfortable to stay 3 secs on the object but it would suit better for fast collision.
i also found funny that only in the ""no feedback"" condition i noticed my virtual hand could not collide inside the cube and then my hand position was dissociated from the virtual position

i would say like a vibration"
13,1,female,left,1,1,1,6,5,6,4,3,5,4,4,6,5,5,7,5,"it's interesting to feel tactile feedback on the finger, but we can't feel the texture of the surface with this experience
it was pleasant and the experience was interesting because it provided new sensations that we don't experiment usually. the feeling on the finger
were like soft tickles.
for the virtual hand, i had the feeling that my real hand was below the virtual during the experience. thus, i had to push down deeper to touch the surface. otherwise, it was really interesting, thanks."
14,1,male,left,1,0,0,6,5,5,5,2,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,5,touching a low voltage battery more than a real surface
15,1,male,right,1,0,0,5,7,5,3,2,1,3,4,6,5,6,6,5,"interesting, but the sensation is a bit strange.
it feels like touching a motor turned on"
16,2,male,left,1,1,0,5,6,6,5,1,1,5,3,4,6,5,6,5,"electrotactile a bit strong; suystem is heavy
the feedback was a bit too strong at the surface"
17,1,male,right,1,0,0,7,6,7,4,5,3,5,4,7,7,7,7,7,"i like it, it is very interesting approach by having the right intensity i believe it can help users to acknowledge the moment when they're contacting a surface. great job.
the intensity i chose was higher than expected"
18,2,male,right,1,1,0,6,6,5,3,2,1,2,4,5,6,6,7,6,"at the beginning a bit less (enjoyable) but once use to the electrotactile feedback it was good.
it's tingling"
19,1,male,right,0,0,0,5,7,7,6,5,2,5,5,6,5,5,7,6,"when the upper threshold (pain) was at maximum (9mA), i didn't feel any difference in feedback between the surface and the inside of the wooden cube
""picotements agreables"""
20,2,male,right,1,0,0,4,4,5,5,1,1,1,5,6,6,7,5,5,"1) unnatural because sensation is pulsatil (it is not a pressure or a vibration)
2) the material to attach electrotactile ""velcro"" was heavy and too tight
3) first calibration was hard because i had difficulties to differentiate between the sensation of velcro and electrotactile feedback"
21,1,female,right,1,0,0,6,5,6,3,3,5,3,6,5,4,4,3,5,the electrotactile feedback is to soft when i touch the box. i need to penetrate ht ebox to feel the electrotactile feedback
22,1,male,right,1,0,0,6,7,7,4,6,6,6,3,7,6,6,6,5,"- interesting to have the dual feedback
- i had the reflexes to higher the finger whereas the captor was attached to the hand
- the electrodes sensation were unpleasant, nearly painful
the sensation generated by the electrodes was unpleasant, hence it was instinctive to reduce the annoyance and higher my hand when i was too low.
at sometime it went from no sensation at all to a moderate sensation, without having the lowest one."
23,2,female,right,1,1,1,5,7,6,3,2,3,3,4,6,7,7,7,6,"stingy/tingle sensation, like a multitude of very very thin needles are poking you on the finger"
24,1,male,right,0,0,0,6,6,5,3,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,"-first time vr
- 1st calibrationwere good (almost very good and cool)
- 2nd a bit less because of the higher calibration i guess (a bit painful)
sensation of noise in the finger"
